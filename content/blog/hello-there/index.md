This is my first post on my new blog site! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a quick into about me and what I do.

> I am a Software Developer based out of Hyderabad, Telangana, India. I constantly make efforts to upgrade and stay updated with the recent trends of technology and like to engage in the tech community.

## My Background

I had worked for Uangteman Technologies Private Limited, an Indonesian fintech startup straight after completing my under-graduation from Vidya Jyothi Institute of Technology. Meanwhile, I got the opportunity to go for on-site visit to Jakarta which was a memorable experience and a sense of good feeling for an early professional to get this chance.
